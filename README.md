# Ladicka (name TBD)
[Ladicka] is a guitar tuner for the modern times. Written primarily so that I can learn how to work with sound, and also to learn CPP for a bit. 
## What needs to be done:
* picking a name
* picking libraries that I will use (FFTW, GTKmm)
* writing a simple window app to show the amount of sound that comes from the microphone
* fouriering the signal according to the https://www.chciken.com/digital/signal/processing/2020/05/13/guitar-tuner.html
* picking the tone the player is likely to be tuning
* display how wrong he is
* allow for setting how sensitive the fourier transform is
